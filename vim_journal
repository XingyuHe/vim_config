This is my vim journal, documenting what I did in Vim in order to make it better. The purpose of this journal is to replicate the configurations of this vim if necessary in the future

1. Download the awesome vim configuration from github/Xingyuhe/vim_config
2. Apply YouCompleteMe.
    a. In general, just put the github repository into my_plugins.
    b. Specifically on YCM, you need to run 'python install.py' before any update.
3. Apply superTab.
    a. I installed superTab via 'supertab.vmb' file. Simply open file and run the command ':source %'.
4. Remap Keys:
    a. Use the command '*noremap' where * can be 'v','i','n'.
5. Copy into "+:
    a. First need to make sure that the version of vim support copy.
